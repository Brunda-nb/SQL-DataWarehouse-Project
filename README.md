## Data Lineage

This diagram visually represents how data flows through the project from its source to the final output.

- It helps to understand the key steps where data is collected, transformed, and used.  
- By seeing this flow, anyone can quickly grasp how data moves and changes in the system.  
- It supports transparency and trust in the data and insights generated.  
- This is especially useful for stakeholders who want a high-level overview without diving into technical details.
