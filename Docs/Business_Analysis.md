# Understanding Business Object Analysis

When we talk about **analyzing business objects**, weâ€™re essentially trying to **understand and evaluate the key entities, their attributes, relationships, and behaviors** that are part of a business domain or system.

## 1. Definition of a Business Object
A **business object** is a representation of something important to the business.  
It could be:
- **Physical**: Product, Customer, Invoice
- **Conceptual**: Order, Contract, Payment
- **Event**: Sale Transaction, Shipment

In software or data systems, these objects often map directly to:
- Database tables
- API resources
- Classes in object-oriented programming
- Entities in BI tools (like SAP BusinessObjects, Tableau metadata, etc.)

## 2. Why We Analyze Them
By analyzing business objects, we aim to:
- **Understand the domain** â€” how the business works.
- **Identify key data points** needed for decision-making.
- **Spot relationships** (e.g., a Customer places an Order; an Order has multiple Products).
- **Define business rules** (e.g., an Invoice must be paid within 30 days).
- **Ensure alignment** between IT systems and real-world business needs.

## 3. What the Analysis Involves
When analyzing business objects, we typically look at:

| Area | Example Questions |
|------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Why does this object exist in the business? |
| **Attributes** | What fields describe it? (Customer Name, DOB, Email) |
| **Relationships** | What other objects is it linked to? (Customer â†” Order) |
| **Lifecycle** | How does it change over time? (Order: Created â†’ Paid â†’ Shipped) |
| **Business Rules** | What constraints apply? (An Order must have at least one Product) |
| **Data Quality** | Are values complete, valid, and accurate? |
| **Usage** | Where and how is this object used in reporting, analytics, or transactions? |

## 4. Outcome of Business Object Analysis
After analyzing, you should have:
- **A clear data model** showing entities and relationships.
- **Well-defined fields** with business-friendly names and definitions.
- **Mapped processes** explaining how data flows between business objects.
- **Requirements for dashboards, reports, or APIs** that use these objects.
- **Gap identification** â€” finding missing attributes or unclear relationships.

ðŸ’¡ **Simple Example**  
If you analyze a `Customer` business object, you might find:
- Attributes: CustomerID, Name, Email, Phone, Join Date
- Relationships: A Customer has many Orders; Orders link to Products.
- Rules: CustomerID is unique; Email must be valid.
- Usage: Needed for CRM, marketing campaigns, sales analytics.
